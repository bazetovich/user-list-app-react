Launching steps:
- install Node.js
- run "npm install" command in project folder to install all dependencies
- run "npm start" command to start development server, then open http://localhost:3000 in the browser
- run "npm run build" command to build production bundle, then open build folder and open index.html in the browser.
(need to correct pathes a bit for .js and .css in index.html, because project is built assuming it is hosted at the server root)
- also need internet connection for the font downloading

NOTICE: I already made a production build so you can just open build/index.html in the browser.
