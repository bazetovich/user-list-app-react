Launching steps:
- install Node.js
- run "npm install" command in project folder to install all dependencies
- run "npm start" command to start development server, then open http://localhost:3000 in the browser
- run "npm run build" command to build production bundle, then open build folder and open index.html in the browser.

WARNING: I already made a production build, because after every building need to correct pathes in index.html for .js and .css files manually,
so you can just open build/index.html in the browser
